  description: "## Introduction\r\nThe OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard,\
    \ language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers\
    \ to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to\
    \ source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly\
    \ defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with\
    \ a minimal amount of implementation logic.\r\n\r\nAn OpenAPI definition can then\
    \ be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation\
    \ tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing\
    \ tools, and many other use cases.\r\n\r\n| Version | URL | Description |\r\n\

    delete:
      description: |-
        Use the query string resource to delete `Account` record. The method contains two parameters `Id` and `Name`. Specify the record `{Id}`, `Name` using `Id,Username, ExternalId` field(s) value and use the `DELETE` method of the resource to delete a record.

        Method returns an extended `Account` structure. Here, all foreign key fields are abstract object structures, utilizing `AbstractText` or `AbstractLong` data types, offering a detailed view of the data and related entities.

        Foreign key fields are: `TenantId, LanguageId, TimezoneId, DateFormatId`

        ### Delete a record of Account
        * If the `Id` field value is not matched, then a `404` error is reported (`Errors/Not Found`), and the error record is returned.
        * If the `Id` field value is matched multiple times, then a `400` error is reported (`Errors/Multible Rows`), and the error record is returned.
        * If the `Id,Username, ExternalId` field value is matched multiple times, then a `400` error is reported (`Errors/Multible Rows`), and the error record is returned.

        The response body will contain the object of the deleted record if the call is successful.

        Utilize this method to execute a query designed to fetch comprehensive information, delivering all results in a singular response. If necessary, the method returns a portion of the results along with an identifier to retrieve the remaining data.

        Leverage the search service to extract the requisite information from the system effectively.

        The method returns a list structured with an extended `Account` representation. In this format, all foreign key fields are depicted as abstract object structures, employing `AbstractText` or `AbstractLong` data types. This offers an enriched and detailed perspective of the data and its associated entities.

        The foreign key fields involved are: `TenantId, LanguageId, TimezoneId, DateFormatId`

        ### Example
        It searches for employees whose data has been modified since January 1, 2022, and belong to departments with external system identifiers DE001 and DE002. The system responds by returning the name, external identifier, and email address of the relevant employees. The retrieved information is organized in ascending order by the person&#39;s name, and a limit is set to return a maximum of 1000 rows.

        ```http
        fields=Name,ExternalId,Email&amp;Filters=(DepartmentId.ExternalId In DE001;DE002) AND (ModifiedOn &gt; 2022-01-01)&amp;Orders=Name ASC&amp;PageSize=1000

          In the List methods, filtering of resources can be performed using filter parameters.

          You can also use parent tables as a search filter. For example, the `Employee` table has a `DepartmentId` field, so you can search for a department name using the `DepartmentId.Name` field name. All fields in the parent table are available.

          The name of the entity field. Example: `Name` or relation field `OwnerId.Name`

          Please refer to the corresponding method&#39;s documentation for the complete list of supported filter parameters by record.

          The operator must be a standard comparison operator =, &lt;&gt;, &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=, In, Like, NotIn

          You can add multiple values separated by comma when using the `In`, `NotIn` operators.
          Example of text field; `USA; FIN; ARE`
          Example of numeric field; `1, 2, 3`

          Example of filters:
          ```sql
          Filters=(DepartmentId.Name = My Department) AND (DepartmentId.CreatedOn = 2021-01-01)

        Utilize this method to execute a query designed to fetch comprehensive information, delivering all results in a singular response. If necessary, the method returns a portion of the results along with an identifier to retrieve the remaining data.

        Leverage the search service to extract the requisite information from the system effectively.

        The method returns a list structured with an extended `Picture` representation. In this format, all foreign key fields are depicted as abstract object structures, employing `AbstractText` or `AbstractLong` data types. This offers an enriched and detailed perspective of the data and its associated entities.

        The foreign key fields involved are: `AccountId`

        ### Example
        It searches for employees whose data has been modified since January 1, 2022, and belong to departments with external system identifiers DE001 and DE002. The system responds by returning the name, external identifier, and email address of the relevant employees. The retrieved information is organized in ascending order by the person&#39;s name, and a limit is set to return a maximum of 1000 rows.

        ```http
        fields=Name,ExternalId,Email&amp;Filters=(DepartmentId.ExternalId In DE001;DE002) AND (ModifiedOn &gt; 2022-01-01)&amp;Orders=Name ASC&amp;PageSize=1000

          In the List methods, filtering of resources can be performed using filter parameters.

          You can also use parent tables as a search filter. For example, the `Employee` table has a `DepartmentId` field, so you can search for a department name using the `DepartmentId.Name` field name. All fields in the parent table are available.

          The name of the entity field. Example: `Name` or relation field `OwnerId.Name`

          Please refer to the corresponding method&#39;s documentation for the complete list of supported filter parameters by record.

          The operator must be a standard comparison operator =, &lt;&gt;, &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=, In, Like, NotIn

          You can add multiple values separated by comma when using the `In`, `NotIn` operators.
          Example of text field; `USA; FIN; ARE`
          Example of numeric field; `1, 2, 3`

          Example of filters:

        Use the `TenantPost` object resource to insert or update (Upsert) `Tenant` using `UserId,TenantId.Name` field(s) value.

        You can supply the required field values in the request data, and then use the `POST` method of the resource.

        The input parameter must be used in the `TenantData` record structure inside the `FieldType` parameter in the foreign key fields.

        Foreign key fields are: `UserId, TenantId, AccountId`

        ### Update a record of Tenant
        * If the `UserId` field value is not matched, then a `404` error is reported (`Errors/Not Found`), and the error record is returned.. You cannot change `UserId` field value (primary key).
        * If the `TenantId.Name` field value is not empty and `UserId` field value is empty, action try insert record according `TenantId.Name` field value (if set, the value is a unique identifier).

        ### Create a new record of Tenant
        * If the value in the `TenantId.Name` and `UserId` fields are empty then action insert a new record according input parameter entity record structure (`TenantData`).

        The response body will contain the object of the updated or created record if the call is successful. Method returns an extended `Tenant` structure. Here, all foreign key fields are abstract object structures, utilizing `AbstractText` or `AbstractLong` data types, offering a detailed view of the data and related entities.

      description: The object provides metadata about the list of items returned in
        the API response. It typically includes information that helps clients understand
        and work with the data.
      example:
        Type: User
        PageSize: 50
        CurrentPage: 50

            \ It's useful for implementing pagination, as clients can use it to calculate\
            \ the number of pages or total available items."

          description: This field specifies the current page of results being returned.
            It's often used in conjunction with `PageSize` to manage pagination by

          example: 50
          format: int32
          type: integer
        PageSize:
          default: 50
          description: The field indicates the number of items returned in a single
